Statistical analysis used for my masters dissertation in veterinary medicine.


The database used consists of data colected during my internship, containing data of Dried Salted Cod and related products temperature, humidity and detected non-conformities.
Drescriptive statistics were the focus, with Fisher's exact test being applied to assess association between product rejection and its non-conformity and type of non-conformity.

Since January 2023, I am focused on analysing temperature data as a time series, together with weather data from Google Earth Engine, to experiment and learn about predictive modelling.
